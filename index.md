# Introduction

Alexander is a PhD student of Information Science & Technology at Syracuse University's iSchool. He is an affiliate of Center for Computational and Data Sciences (CCDS) and Behavior, Information, Technology, and Society (BITS) lab. He has a Masters and Bachelors in Economics from Georgia State University and University of West Georgia respectively. His current research narrative is in understanding how people learn to communicate to each other in specialized information spaces online when words offer too much or not enough.

Alexander's research is closely tied to memetics: the study of memes. More generally, he is interested in new media research and digital documents in their relation to semantics, social media platform policy, web protocols, and grass-roots protest movements. His theoretical structure is around new materialism, affect, semiotics, and power. He considers himself a mixed methods information scholar. His methodological perspectives are drawing from various network methodologies (i.e. SNA, ANT, and scientometrics), content analysis, and rhetoric.

Alexander spends most of his time reading various fields of philosophy, social science theory, and virtual culture. Additionally, he is developing skills in Python and R for data science, network methods, and data visualization. Alexander spends his time outside of PhD work playing with coffee and digital data art.
