## Baym and “Community"
In Nancy K. Bayms’ discussion on Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) there is a careful empirical perspective of online groups and a consideration of them as a different kind of social organization.[^1] In particular, Dr. Baym proposes her chapter as moving towards answering the question of “What occurs on-line that leads some people to experience \[on-line communities\] as communities in the first place \(p 38\)?”

Dr. Bayms introduces the chapter with a summary discussion of the political nuances of what a community might be and how interactions online might not be. Then she goes on to discuss in accordance with past literature in CMC how communication online seems to feel like community in “style” and simply avoids the question of whether or not they actually are communities. Still repeatedly it would appear as though she would prefer to call social interaction online “communities” as she repeatedly phrases her sentences explicitly calling them communities repeatedly rather than some other form of pseudo-community, proxy community, or otherwise. Even to me, it seems as though this discrepancy in terminology is primarily a semantic discussion in the context of CMC scholarship of the 1990s.

In the summary discussion, there are a few arguments that are given potential legitimacy on this semantic particularity. Dr. Bayms’ claims the opposition of the most weight are “homogeny and lack of moral commitment” \(p 36\). I will address these in turn.

Firstly, on the grounds of “homogeny”, if I am to unpack the argument, is that online groups organize in accordance with their immediate interests in a way that offline communities cannot. So these online groups create what has popularly been popularly been deemed “filter bubbles” as of recently. Additionally this is the phenomena that a network scientist might call homophily, or as my grandmother might have said, “birds of a feather...”. This is actually a very broad discussion in academia in all sorts of social realms. It has even been noted in semantics literature that words themselves tend to organize closer together in accordance to their meanings; As Firth famously put it, “We shall know a word by the company it keeps” (p 11).[^2] In modern urban economics literature it has been noted that people tend to move to locations which agree with them politically and economically, or as it has been put ‘voting with ones feet’.[^3]

In using these comparisons of various notions what one might call “community” in various kinds of social groups, I hope it is clear that the argument that whatever online homogeny that exists, it can only be argued as problematic if it a quantitative matter of degree of similarity of users. Clearly, if people literally move to the same geographically based community in a city because of their political or economic similarities, one cannot simply argue that social groups online are not “communities” because of that same qualification. Thus, I would suggest that if we are to continue this line of argument, there either must be some kind of state-change to “pseudo-community”, and arbitrary degree of difference, or there must be further qualification in making this claim. Regardless, to my current knowledge, this seems like an insubstantial difference.

Indeed, I would like to take a step further and suggest perhaps a radical notion. I believe that online social groups are much more diverse for the very notion that Dr. Baym suggests might legitimize the opposition. Baym notes that people online are a simple hyperlink or web address away in leaving the social group and that this might make it believable that online groups are much less diverse as members can leave as soon as they prefer not to be there. Although this may be true, but they can show up just the same. Because of this, a person online can follow literally thousands of blogs, web forums and sub-forums, Facebook pages and groups, and so on. I might have one question to ask on Reddit and never use that site again. But yet, the fact that this is constantly happening with all different manners of users mean it must be possible that the exact opposite of Baym’s proposed argument occurs. There could be a total osmosis of ideas and socially untrained behaviors that pass through social groups online depending on the way that group’s norms and its site’s infrastructure construct the group dynamic (or lack thereof). In fact, the lack of “community” online could be the opposite problem, we cannot simply assume people know the rules. In fact, it would seem traffic through a literal neighborhood or geo-based community seems relatively fixed and normalized.[^4] [^5] It’s the online ones that very easily might not be; they are the ones who could precisely have to deal with matters of extreme diversity.

Secondly, Dr. Bayms suggests that perhaps one might give credit to the fact that there’s a “lack of moral commitment”. Actually, here might be the legitimate qualification. If what I have suggested is true, it could be a group may struggle to commit itself to policies of moral norms, or rather when it does, it commits itself to something of a “hard-coded” morality that was not the basis of the informational demands of of those group members to come. Clearly, finding any kind of “consensus” of a group with eternally interchangeable members is problematic. The result of online group policy is bound to be compared to either something akin to mob mentality or representative of some group moderator’s authoritative moral perspective. If we were to consider, for example, a single online sub-forum to be existing as a kind of fixed social institution without regards to the informational demands of those in it, I think this argument would quickly be accepted as either ethical anarchy or authoritarian depending on the infrastructure of the sub-forum.

However, I find this also to be a naive handwavy definition of community that is based on historic notions of personal experience of social that do not seem very generalizable or theoretically precise. For example, I do not simply “live” on my Facebook wall online. I use many different communities at different times for different things and my commitments in these spaces are variable. Even my own online “location” is variable depending on changing tastes and informational demands for these social groups. Also, the sheer diversity of possibilities for how to manage (or not) the kinds of people that can get into an online social group, the sets of rules (or lack thereof), and the possible kinds of static infrastructure that organize informational flow seems to allow for a near incomprehensibly many options for how to communicate with others. If one group is normalizing, marginalizing, or otherwise a certain group of people, and it is a large hub, certainly marginalized groups will develop their own groups. Also, certainly some of these groups will still maintain contact with the marginalizing location also. Thus, I would argue that socially the communication still exists among these groups and there ultimately will be important moral discussion. And further, I think that if there are spaces that are largely deemed unethical, if they are relatively closed off perhaps they either will eventually die out. Or perhaps what this group is saying will explode to the forefront if they feel what they are saying in their sub-forum social group is suppressed by the larger online social groups.

Certainly this has happened, and occurs frequently on Reddit, often infamously when decisions are made to shut down sub-forums, and because of the nature of Reddit, it seems that it immediately becomes a much larger discussion such as was the case with several alt-right groups and, prior to that, several fat-shaming sub-forums. Because of this larger discussion, the very notions of how Reddit moderators manages moral standards on its pages came into question. Because this does occur, it would seem that there are places where there are dynamics of group morality which relate closely with how people “vote with their feet” and that frequently, these discussions happen in a very public way in the larger community. In this sense, one cannot simply discount the dynamic nature of the connections between groups, and how those dynamics inform groups that may not immediately seem connected. These certainly are not silos of information. Infamously b/ on 4chan has influenced the world at large with its morally questionable shenanigans.[^6] I would go so far as to suggest that there is not a living person in Europe or the U.S. between the ages of 15 and 55 that has not been culturally influenced by b/ in some way, whether they would know it or not. Perhaps even if they did know, it could be advisable for them to say otherwise at present, much as one might be advised to say they have not smoked marijuana if they were running for president. Although it would be near impossible for a president of the past 40 years to say with honesty they have not tried the reefer, because, “let’s be real”. I propose the same squinty-eyed judgment the influence of b/ to a denier even if this denier come by it entirely honestly. If one knows of b/, one most definitely has been influenced, and the very fact that one might deny it is acceptance of the fact that moral interests are considered with online communities that we claim to affiliate with.

In the midst of the above rambling about considerations of the ethical dilemma of “community” of in online social space, I wish to make a few things clear. It seems obvious that social groups online, as we see them, are cases of grounding empirical ethical debate almost as one might have with political economic systems with countries or state policy. So it would seem trivial to make this distinction that online communities do not have ethical discussions or even are closed to external debate on ethical dilemmas because of the flow of information between these groups. I very clearly do see the same memes on Reddit as I do on Facebook, and in fact there have been entire Facebook pages dedicated to using other well known social medium to use that format in irony. WikiHow memes are brilliant and poetic in a very haiku-like way for anyone who does not know. Online social groups are not exactly silos even if one accounts for these groups’ moral norms indirectly. These groups are more or less interconnected, and that degree of connectedness also inherits direct their connected moral discussion that become a part of social groups. If one wishes to question this any further, one merely has to question the same ideals among academic invisible colleges.[^7] These are much smaller and much more closed off to social groups at large. There are a significant number of academic groups with fewer people than the number of people you meet in a weekend. Would you or would you not consider your own academic writing group conversing on broad (and specific) social moral dilemma in and outside of your social group? If not, then academia as a whole has failed to do its job. So we should be careful if only for pragmatic reasons what we claim necessary amounts of ethical discussion to qualify a social group a “community” unless we are not worried about invalidating our own social experience.
